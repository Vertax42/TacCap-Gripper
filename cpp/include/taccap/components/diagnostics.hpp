    // Free-running UART counters since MCU boot (Cmd 0x54).
    //
    // The reason this exists: when the host sees a status frame arrive short a
    // couple of bytes, nothing on the host can say whether the MCU failed to
    // send them or whether they were lost after leaving it. `tx_bytes_ok` and
    // `tx_calls_ok` count only what the firmware's transmit call accepted, so
    // comparing them against what the host decoded over the same window
    // separates the two:
    //
    //   firmware frame count == host (received + missing), bytes short
    //       -> lost downstream of the MCU's transmit register. Cable or
    //          USB-serial bridge; no firmware change reaches it.
    //   tx_fail_timeout > 0
    //       -> the firmware truncated frames itself.
    //   rx_overflow > 0
    //       -> the firmware's command task could not keep up with the host.
    //
    // Counters are cumulative, so take a reading before and after a
    // measurement window and subtract.
    //
    // `log_dropped` reads 0 against firmware 1.1.3, which answered with a
    // 32-byte packet that had no such field — it is not distinguishable from a
    // genuine zero, so gate on firmware_version() if that matters to you.

    // configuration the firmware reports as active afterwards.
    //
    // **This is a diagnostic lever, not a setting to leave on.** The firmware's
    // log sink is a blocking polled UART write — roughly 0.5 ms per line at
    // 921600 — and it blocks whichever task emitted the line. Logging on every
    // received command is what livelocked the firmware's command channel badly
    // enough to need a power cycle, which is why 1.1.4 ships with logging off.
    // Turn it on to look at something, then turn it back off.
    //
    // Output goes to the MCU's own DEBUG UART, which is not routed through the
    // USB bridge — you need a probe on that pin to read it. Enabling logging
    // without one costs you the realtime penalty and shows you nothing.
